bio: Alan is a computational relativistic astrophysicist who studies neutron star mergers and tests of Einstein's theory of gravity using numerical simulations. His research explores alternative theories of gravity through binary merger simulations, investigating how deviations from general relativity might appear in gravitational wave signals. He develops advanced numerical methods for modeling relativistic jets and has contributed to our understanding of how massive scalar fields affect neutron star properties and merger dynamics.
