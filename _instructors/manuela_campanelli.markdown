bio: Manuela is a world-leading expert in numerical relativity and gravitational wave astrophysics at RIT's Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation. Her groundbreaking simulations of black hole mergers provided crucial theoretical predictions that enabled the historic first detection of gravitational waves by LIGO in 2015. She develops cutting-edge computational methods to model the most violent events in the universe, from binary black hole coalescences to neutron star mergers, helping unlock the secrets of Einstein's spacetime through high-performance computing and multi-messenger astronomy.
