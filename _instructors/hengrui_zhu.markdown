bio: Hengrui is a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics at Princeton University specializing in black hole physics and gravitational wave research. His work focuses on the theoretical aspects of black hole dynamics, including studies of black hole ringdown and the imprints of gravitational radiation-reaction on black hole mass and spin evolution. He investigates how gravitational wave observations can reveal fundamental properties of these extreme astrophysical objects and contributes to our understanding of general relativity in the strong-field regime.
