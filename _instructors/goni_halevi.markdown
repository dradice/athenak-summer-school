bio: Goni is a computational astrophysicist who studies the most explosive events in the universe, from supernovae to neutron star mergers. She uses cutting-edge simulations that combine general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics, and nuclear physics to understand how the heaviest elements are created and scattered throughout the cosmos. Her work bridges theory and observation, creating end-to-end models of stellar explosions and compact object collisions that help interpret gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals.
