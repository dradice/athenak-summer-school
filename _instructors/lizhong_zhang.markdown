bio: Lizhong is a computational astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study who specializes in theoretical and numerical studies of black holes and their environments. His research focuses on developing advanced computational methods to simulate extreme astrophysical phenomena, including black hole mergers, accretion disks, and relativistic jets. Using cutting-edge numerical relativity techniques, he investigates how black holes interact with surrounding matter and magnetic fields, contributing to our understanding of gravitational wave sources and high-energy astrophysical processes.
