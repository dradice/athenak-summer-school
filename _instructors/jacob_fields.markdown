bio: Jacob is a computational astrophysicist specializing in numerical relativity simulations of neutron star and black hole mergers. His research focuses on developing advanced computational methods for studying gravitational wave sources, including thermal effects in binary mergers and performance optimization for next-generation codes like AthenaK. As a key developer of relativistic hydrodynamics solvers, he bridges high-performance computing with fundamental physics to understand the most extreme events in the universe.
