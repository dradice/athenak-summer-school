bio: James is a pioneer in computational astrophysics who developed some of the most widely used simulation codes in the field, including ZEUS and Athena. His research focuses on fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics to understand phenomena like star formation, black hole accretion flows, and planet formation in stellar disks. As a member of the National Academy of Sciences, he continues to push the boundaries of high-precision astrophysical simulations using cutting-edge numerical methods.
