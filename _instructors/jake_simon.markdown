bio: Jake is a computational astrophysicist who studies planet formation using sophisticated computer simulations on some of the nation's largest supercomputers. His research focuses on understanding how planets are born, with particular emphasis on planetesimals—the building blocks of planets ranging from 1 km to 100 km in size, such as asteroids, comets, and Kuiper Belt Objects. He develops theoretical models of planet formation processes and validates them through collaboration with observational astronomers. His work also extends to studying accretion processes around black holes, investigating how hot gas spirals into these objects and releases tremendous radiation.
