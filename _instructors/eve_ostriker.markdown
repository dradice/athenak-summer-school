bio: Eve is the Lyman Spitzer Jr. Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at Princeton, studying how stars are born and how they shape their galactic environments. She uses powerful supercomputer simulations to model the complex physics of star formation, from the turbulent interstellar medium where stars are born to how stellar feedback affects galaxy evolution. Her computational work combines fundamental physics laws governing gravity, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetic radiation to understand the cosmic cycle of stellar birth, life, and death.
