bio: David studies extreme astrophysical events like neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae using large-scale computer simulations. His research combines general relativity with high-performance computing to understand what happens when cosmic objects collide and how heavy elements are created. He is a key developer of AthenaK and his work helps answer fundamental questions about matter at extreme densities and the fate of massive stars.
