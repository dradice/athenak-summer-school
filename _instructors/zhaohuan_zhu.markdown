bio: Zhaohuan studies how planets form in the swirling disks of gas and dust around young stars. His research combines sophisticated computer simulations with observations to understand the complex physics of protoplanetary disks, from magnetohydrodynamics to radiation transport. He uses supercomputers to model everything from tiny dust grains to giant planets, helping predict what telescopes should see as they watch planetary systems being born throughout the galaxy.
