bio: George is a computational and theoretical astrophysicist studying high-energy phenomena near supermassive black holes. His research combines numerical methods and analytic modeling to understand accretion processes and magnetic field dynamics around black holes. As a member of the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration and co-coordinator of its Theory Working Group, he contributes to cutting-edge black hole imaging and modeling efforts. His work bridges general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with observational astronomy.
