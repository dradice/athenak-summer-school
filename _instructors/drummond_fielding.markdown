bio: Drummond is a theoretical astrophysicist who studies how galaxies regulate their growth through stellar feedback and galactic winds. His research uses large-scale numerical simulations to understand how supernovae and stellar winds drive gas out of galaxies, affecting their ability to form new stars. He combines computational fluid dynamics with plasma physics to model the complex multiphase flows in the interstellar medium, helping explain how galaxies evolve over cosmic time.
